		<b>Chapter 1: Brief History of the Internet</b>
			</summary>
			<p>As far back as the early stirrings of the Cold War, the concept of a network connecting
			computers was under development by both government and university researchers looking
			for a better means to communicate and share research. The military at the time relied in
			part on microwave transmission technology for communications. An unexpected attack on
			some of these towers demonstrated how susceptible the technology was to failure of even
			small portions of the transmission path. This led the military to seek a method of communicating 
			that could withstand attack. At the same time, university researchers were trying
			to share their work between campuses, and were struggling with similar problems when
			their transmissions suffered drops in signal. Parties from both groups ended up at the same
			conference with presentations, and decided to collaborate in order to further their work.</p>
		
			<p>At the time, computers were far from what we know them as today. A single computer
			was a large, immobile assortment of equipment that took up an entire room. Data entry was
			done by using punched cards of paper, or the newest method of the time, magnetic tapes.
			Interacting with the computer meant reserving time on the equipment and traveling to
			where it was. Most machines were owned by universities, large corporations, or government
			organizations due to the staffing demands, size, and cost to acquire and maintain them. The
			image below depicts the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNIVAC_I">UNIVAC 1</a>, a system used by the United States Census Bureau
			and other large organizations like universities. One of the fastest machines at the time, it
			could perform roughly 1000 calculations per second.</p>
		
			<p>In comparison, the K computer, a super computer produced in 2012 by the Japanese
			company Fujitsu, was capable of 10 petaflops per second when it was launched. Before you reach for your dictionary or calculator, we will break that down. FLOPS stands for
			floating point operations per second, or in basic terms, the number of calculations the
			system can finish in one second. A petaflop is a numerical indicator of how many 1015 (10
			with 15 zeroes after it) calculations are completed per second. So, 10 petaflops means the
			K computer can complete 1015 calculations ten times in one second. If we fed the UNIVAC
			1 just a single petaflop of data the day it was turned on, it would still be working on the
			problem today. In fact, it would barely be getting started, just a mere 60+ years into a
			roughly 317,098-year task!</p>
		
			<p>As cold war tensions grew and Sputnik was launched, the United States Department of
			Defense (DoD) began to seek additional methods of transmitting information to supple-
			ment existing methods. They sought something that was decentralized, allowing better
			resiliency in case of attack, where damage at one point would not necessarily disrupt com-
			munication. Their network, Arpanet, connected the DoD and participating universities
			together for the first time. In order to standardize the way networked systems communicated, 
			the Transfer Control Protocol/Internetwork Protocol (TCP/IP) was created. As
			various network systems migrated to this standard, they could then communicate with any
			network using the protocol. <b>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet">Internet</a> was born</b>.</p>
		
			<p>Email was soon to follow, as users of the networks were interested in the timely transmission 
			and notification of messages. This form of messaging fit one of their initial goals.
			As time progressed, additional protocols were developed to address particular tasks, like
			FTP for file transfers and UDP for time-sensitive, error-resistant tasks.</p>
		
			<p>Ongoing improvements in our ability to move more information, and move it faster,
			between systems progressed at a rate similar to the calculative power of the computers we
			saw earlier. This brings us to where we are today; able to watch full-length movies, streamed
			in high quality right to our phones and computers, even while riding in a car.</p>

		<b>Chapter 4: Network Basics</b>
			</summary>
			<p><b>IP Addresses</b><br>An IP (Internet Protocol) address is a unique code that identifies a piece of equipment
			connected to a network. These addresses are used in messages between network devices like
			the network or wireless card in your computer, the equipment from your ISP (internet
			service provider), and all pieces of equipment between your machine and the one your
			computer needs to talk to.</p>
		
			<p>IP Addresses live in the network layer, which is one of seven layers in the protocol suite
			defined in the OSI Model. The OSI model stands for Open Systems Interconnection, and
			was created by the International Organization for Standardization, an international non-
			governmental group of professionals who strive to establish standards and best practices
			in a variety of fields. The OSI Model for networking breaks the system of transmitting data
			into the layers show below in an attempt to delineate where certain actions should take place.</p>
		
			<p>The seven layers depicted above make up the OSI body’s recommended protocol suite.
			In the diagram, transmission of data crosses two routers and over the Internet to reach its
			destination. By following the data along the arrows, we see it pass through various layers of
			communication and processing as it crosses the internal network, through the first router,
			across the public network (internet connection), into the recipient’s router, and then is
			reassembled into its original form.</p>
		
			<p>Until recently, most network equipment has operated on IPv4, the fourth standard released 
			for IP addresses, which has been in place for about thirty years. Addresses in this
			format are typically represented as a pattern of four blocks of up to three digits separated by
			periods, with no block of numbers exceeding 255 such as 127.0.0.1 or 24.38.1.251. This is
			referred to as dot-decimal representation, and although it is not the only way to express an
			IPv4 address it is the most recognized form. Segments of the addresses within the ranges
			of 192.168.xxx.xxx, 172.16.xxx.xxx to 172.31.xxx.xxx, and 10.0.xxx.xxx to 10.255.xxx.xxx
			are reserved for private networks, meaning they are used within a network in your house,
			at work, or anywhere else where a group of computers share a connection to the internet.</p>
		
			<p>Each of these networks uses one or more of these blocks of numbers for devices on that
			network. Only the equipment connecting that local network to the Internet needs a unique
			address from the rest of the world. That equipment will track which computer inside the
			network to send data to and from by reading packets—the individual pieces of messages
			that are sent across networks. This means your computer might be 192.168.1.25 at home,
			and so might your computer at work, according to your home and work networks. The
			connection between your house and office thought still have a different, unique number
			assigned to them.</p>
		
			<p>This separation of networks was done to reduce the speed at which unique addresses
			were consumed. Although this scheme allows for almost 4.3 billion (accurately, 232) ad-
			dresses, the last one was officially assigned on February 4th, 2012. To sustain today’s growing
			number of devices, IPv6 was created, which is depicted as eight blocks of four hexadecimal
			digits now separated by colons. These new addresses might look like 2001:0db8:85a3:0042
			:1000:8a2e:0370:7334, and can support roughly 4 billion unique addresses. Since the new
			range is so staggeringly large, additional protocols were created that specify when certain
			values or ranges are used in addresses. This allows additional information about the device
			to be conveyed just from the address.</p>
		
			<p>The actual messages sent between machines are broken down into multiple pieces. These
			pieces, called packets, are sent piece by piece from sender to recipient. Each packet is sent
			the fastest way possible, which means some packets may take different routes—picture a
			short cut, or getting off a congested road to take a different one. This helps to ensure that
			the message gets from sender to receiver as fast as possible, but also means packets may
			arrive in a different order than they were sent.</p>
		
			<p>To account for this, each piece of the message, or payload, is wrapped in a header—
			additional information that describes how many other pieces there are, what protocol is
			being used, where the packet came from and is headed to, along with some other related
			information.</p>
		
			<p><b>URL</b><br>Seeing as most of us would have a hard time remembering what IP address is needed to
			get to, say, Facebook (173.252.100.16) or the Weather Channel (96.8.80.132) we instead
			use URLs, universal resource locators. This allows us to use www.facebook.com and www.
			weather.com to get to where we want to go without referring to a long list of IP addresses.
			Specialized servers (called name servers) all around the world are responsible for responding
			to requests from computers for this information. When you type facebook.com into your
			address bar, if your router does not have a note of its own as to where that is, it will “ask” a
			name server, which will look it up in its records and reply.</p>
		
			<p>There are three parts to a network address: the protocol, name, and resource id. The
			protocol represents how we want to send and receive messages, for example we can use
			http:// for accessing websites and ftp:// for moving files. The name is what we associate with the site, 
			like www.facebook.com, and the resource id, or URI, is everything after that,
			which points to the particular file we want to see.</p>
		
			<p><b>Ports</b><br>
			While an IP address and a URL will bring you to a particular web server, there may be
			more than one way you want to interact with it, or more than one thing you want it to do.
			Maybe you also want the server to provide email services, or you want to use FTP to update
			your files. These ports act as different doors into your server, so different applications can
			communicate without getting in each other’s way. Certain ports are typically used for cer-
			tain activities, for example port 80 is the standard port for web traffic (your browser viewing
			a page), as opposed to ftp, which typically uses port 21. Using standard ports is not a rule,
			as applications can be configured to use any available port number, but it is recommended
			in most cases as firewalls and other security devices may require additional configuring to
			keep them from blocking wanted traffic because it is arriving at an unusual, fire walled, or
			“locked” port.</p>
		
			<p><b>Hosting Facilities</b><br>
			If you are using a server that is not under your physical care, and is managed by an off-
			site third party, then you likely have an agreement with a hosting facility. Hosting facilities
			are typically for-profit companies that manage the physical equipment necessary to provide
			access to websites for a number of clients. Many offer web development and management
			services as well, but if you are still reading, then that tidbit is probably of little interest as
			you are here to build it yourself.</p>
			
			<p>The benefit of using a hosting service falls under the same principles as other cloud
			computing services. You are paying to rent equipment and/or services in place of investing
			in equipment and managing the server and Internet connection yourself. Additionally,
			hosting facilities are equipped with backup power sources as well as redundant connections
			to the internet, and may even have multiple facilities that are physically dispersed, ensuring
			their clients have the best up time as possible. Ads like the one below are common to these
			services and often emphasize their best features. Price competition makes for relatively
			affordable hosting for those who are not looking for dedicated servers and are comfortable
			with sharing their (virtual) server resources with other customers.</p>

		<b>Chapter 7: Markup Languages</b>	
			</summary>			
			<p>Document markup is a notation method that defines how particular pieces of information
			are meant to be formatted. The term comes from the practice of marking up manuscripts to
			notate changes that need to be made. Markup in terms of programming languages is used
			to identify a language that specifies how a document is to appear.</p>
		
			<p>If you have ever used multiple colors of ink or highlighter when making notes and
			ascribed meaning to those colors for yourself (e.g., yellow highlighter is important, red
			ink is a definition) then you have already practiced document markup. You are providing
			additional layers of information along with the written text, in this case visual cues as to the
			purpose of the written information.</p>
		
			<p>Some popular markup languages are hypertext markup language (HTML), extensible
			markup language (XML) and extensible hypertext markup language (XHTML).These
			were each created to fulfill particular needs in defining the layout and structure of the
			material.</p>
		
			<p><b>HTML5</b><br>Hypertext markup language is used to aid in the publication of web pages by providing
			a structure that defines elements like tables, forms, lists and headings, and identifies where
			different portions of our content begin and end. It can be used to embed other file formats
			like videos, audio files, documents like PDFs and spreadsheets, among others. HTML is
			the most relied upon language in the creation of web sites. In this text we will focus on
			HTML5. While it is technically still in draft form, many proposed elements are already
			supported by the newer versions of most of the popular browsers.</p>
		
			<p><b>HTML5: History </b>In the beginning, back to the first days of the Internet and ARPA, the primary purpose
			of creating a page was to share research and information. HTML tags were only meant to
			provide layout and formatting of a page. As such, early implementations of HTML were
			somewhat limited as there was little demand for features beyond the basics. Headings,
			bullets, tables, and color were about all developers had to utilize. As sites were created for
			other more commercial uses, developers found creative ways of using these tools to get their
			pages looking more like magazines, advertisements, and what they had drawn on paper.
			Having been one of those developers, I recall the days of just-get-it-looking-right tech-
			niques, splicing page-sized images into tables so graphics were (usually) where we wanted
			them, nesting tables within tables to create complex layouts, and other methods that violate
			today’s best practices.</p>
		
			<p><b>HTML5: Current State </b>While not formally finalized, many browsers are already supporting a number of features
			proposed in drafts of HTML5, including things like canvas and media support that greatly
			improve the browser’s ability to process and display complex materials without requiring
			extensive coding and extensions. In the past, sites that used video and audio players had to
			integrate support for many players, and would have to include the libraries and formatted
			files for those systems in their sites. By providing a solution to using these media forms
			within HTML5, we can improve on the user experience and reduce the efforts necessary
			to provide them.</p>
			
			<p>While these new features do reduce the amount of programming required to imple-
			ment higher level elements, and include interactive elements that exceed document markup
			activities, HTML5 is still considered a markup language.</p>
			
			<p>In these languages, we use tags to ascribe additional meaning to our text, which provide
			instruction to the browser as to how to display the text on the screen, but are not necessarily
			displayed to the user. In HTML and XHTML these tags are fixed, or predefined, meaning
			the names that can be used in the tags are limited to what browsers are able to recognize.
			In XML, tags are defined by the person creating the content as they are typically used in
			conjunction with data sources and provide information.</p>
		
			<p><b>HTML5: W3C Standards </b>The World Wide Web Consortium,1 or W3C, is an international community that sup-
			ports web development through the creation of open standards that provide the best user
			experience possible for the widest audience of users. This group of professionals and experts
			come together to determine how CSS and HTML should operate, what tags should be
			included as features, and more. The W3C is also your best reference point in determining
			the accessibility of your site through the use of tools that analyze your code for W3C
			compliance. These tools confirm if you have fully implemented elements in your code, like
			providing alternate text descriptions of images in the event that the image cannot load, or
			the user is visually impaired.</p>
		
			<p><b>CSS</b><br>CSS stands for cascading style sheet, and is used to create rules about the color, font, and
			layout of our pages. It also determines when those rules are to be used, based on informa-
			tion like the device connecting to the page, or in response to a user’s action. CSS can be
			used by not only HTML but any XML-based language. By separating as much of the look
			and feel of a page from HTML as possible, we actually separate content from appearance.
			This makes it possible to quickly create several different versions of the appearance of our
			site, without recreating the content in each version. Our best approach is to use HTML to
			define the structure (and only structure) of our pages whenever possible, laying the ground-
			work for CSS to know where to apply the actual style.</p>
			
			<p><b>CSS: History</b> As HTML grew in popularity, demands on its feature set also grew. Combined with the
			variety of browser implementations and their varied approaches to rendering and support,
			creating robust, visually appealing sites involved a significant amount of time and effort. To
			reduce these, and separate the duties of presentation from those of content, proposals were
			sought to define a new system of managing these features. CSS was born out of CHSS,
			or Cascading Hypertext Style Script, and extends our capabilities by allowing us to go far
			beyond the styling limits of HTML by giving us more power over images, making pages
			appear more newspaper or magazine-like with layout and typography affects, and reducing
			load time.</p>
			
			<p>Introduced for public use in 1996, CSS1 contained the ability to apply rules by iden-
			tifying elements (selectors), and most of the properties still in use today. CSS2 added the
			ability to adapt for different displays and devices, as well as positioning elements by specific
			values on the page. CSS2.1 followed with the introduction of additional features, but these
			were not considered substantial enough to warrant a full version number change.</p>
		
			<p><b>CSS: Current State</b> While commonly referred to as CSS3, the numbering no longer applies to the language
			as a whole. The developers have decided to break the language into modules, allowing
			different aspects of the language to be revised and released independent of one another.
			This allows for stable modules to stay numbered as they are (since they are not actually
			changing), while those under more active development can be pushed out as needed. At
			the moment, most of the “current” modules are at version number 3. Some have not really
			changed from 2.1, while work on version 4 of selected modules is already underway.</p>
		
			<p><b>Document Object Model</b><br>Our ability to manipulate and create webpages consistently across formats comes from
			the document object model API, typically referred to as DOM. This API defines the order
			and structure of document files as well as how the file is manipulated to create, edit, or
			remove contents.</p>
		
			<p>The DOM is built to be language and platform independent so any software or program-
			ming language can use it to interface with documents. It defines the interface methods and
			object types that represent elements of documents, the semantics and behavior of attributes
			of those objects, and also defines how they relate to one another. The DOM, effectively,
			is what gives rise to the tags we are about to study below. Languages that use the DOM,
			however, are not required to include all of its features, and may generate additional features
			of their own.</p>
			<p>Figure 20 depicts an example of a document’s model in tree format, with nested ele-
			ments appearing to the right and below their parents. In this example, we are shown an
			HTML page with a section for the head and the body, which includes a page title and a
			link as its contents. This structure provides the ability for us to traverse, or move around the
			document, by referring to an object’s name or attribute.</p>
