		<p><b>Chapter 1: Brief History of the Internet</b></p>
			<p>As far back as the early stirrings of the Cold War, the concept of a network connecting
			computers was under development by both government and university researchers looking
			for a better means to communicate and share research. The military at the time relied in
			part on microwave transmission technology for communications. An unexpected attack on
			some of these towers demonstrated how susceptible the technology was to failure of even
			small portions of the transmission path. This led the military to seek a method of communicating 
			that could withstand attack. At the same time, university researchers were trying
			to share their work between campuses, and were struggling with similar problems when
			their transmissions suffered drops in signal. Parties from both groups ended up at the same
			conference with presentations, and decided to collaborate in order to further their work.</p>
