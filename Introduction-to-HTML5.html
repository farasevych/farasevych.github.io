		<p><b>Chapter 1: Brief History of the Internet</b></p>
			<p>As far back as the early stirrings of the Cold War, the concept of a network connecting
			computers was under development by both government and university researchers looking
			for a better means to communicate and share research. The military at the time relied in
			part on microwave transmission technology for communications. An unexpected attack on
			some of these towers demonstrated how susceptible the technology was to failure of even
			small portions of the transmission path. This led the military to seek a method of communicating 
			that could withstand attack. At the same time, university researchers were trying
			to share their work between campuses, and were struggling with similar problems when
			their transmissions suffered drops in signal. Parties from both groups ended up at the same
			conference with presentations, and decided to collaborate in order to further their work.</p>
		
			<p>At the time, computers were far from what we know them as today. A single computer
			was a large, immobile assortment of equipment that took up an entire room. Data entry was
			done by using punched cards of paper, or the newest method of the time, magnetic tapes.
			Interacting with the computer meant reserving time on the equipment and traveling to
			where it was. Most machines were owned by universities, large corporations, or government
			organizations due to the staffing demands, size, and cost to acquire and maintain them. The
			image below depicts the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNIVAC_I" alt="Univac 1">UNIVAC 1</a>, a system used by the United States Census Bureau
			and other large organizations like universities. One of the fastest machines at the time, it
			could perform roughly 1000 calculations per second.</p>
		
			<p>In comparison, the K computer, a super computer produced in 2012 by the Japanese
			company Fujitsu, was capable of 10 petaflops per second when it was launched. Before you reach for your dictionary or calculator, we will break that down. FLOPS stands for
			floating point operations per second, or in basic terms, the number of calculations the
			system can finish in one second. A petaflop is a numerical indicator of how many 1015 (10
			with 15 zeroes after it) calculations are completed per second. So, 10 petaflops means the
			K computer can complete 1015 calculations ten times in one second. If we fed the UNIVAC
			1 just a single petaflop of data the day it was turned on, it would still be working on the
			problem today. In fact, it would barely be getting started, just a mere 60+ years into a
			roughly 317,098-year task!</p>
		
			<p>As cold war tensions grew and Sputnik was launched, the United States Department of
			Defense (DoD) began to seek additional methods of transmitting information to supple-
			ment existing methods. They sought something that was decentralized, allowing better
			resiliency in case of attack, where damage at one point would not necessarily disrupt com-
			munication. Their network, Arpanet, connected the DoD and participating universities
			together for the first time. In order to standardize the way networked systems communicated, 
			the Transfer Control Protocol/Internetwork Protocol (TCP/IP) was created. As
			various network systems migrated to this standard, they could then communicate with any
			network using the protocol. <b>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet" alt="Internet history">Internet</a> was born</b>.</p>
		
			<p>Email was soon to follow, as users of the networks were interested in the timely transmission 
			and notification of messages. This form of messaging fit one of their initial goals.
			As time progressed, additional protocols were developed to address particular tasks, like
			FTP for file transfers and UDP for time-sensitive, error-resistant tasks.</p>
		
			<p>Ongoing improvements in our ability to move more information, and move it faster,
			between systems progressed at a rate similar to the calculative power of the computers we
			saw earlier. This brings us to where we are today; able to watch full-length movies, streamed
			in high quality right to our phones and computers, even while riding in a car.</p>
		
		<p><b>Chapter 4: Network Basics</b></p>
			<p><b>IP Addresses</b><br>An IP (Internet Protocol) address is a unique code that identifies a piece of equipment
			connected to a network. These addresses are used in messages between network devices like
			the network or wireless card in your computer, the equipment from your ISP (internet
			service provider), and all pieces of equipment between your machine and the one your
			computer needs to talk to.</p>
		
			<p>IP Addresses live in the network layer, which is one of seven layers in the protocol suite
			defined in the OSI Model. The OSI model stands for Open Systems Interconnection, and
			was created by the International Organization for Standardization, an international non-
			governmental group of professionals who strive to establish standards and best practices
			in a variety of fields. The OSI Model for networking breaks the system of transmitting data
			into the layers show below in an attempt to delineate where certain actions should take place.</p>
		
			<p>The seven layers depicted above make up the OSI body’s recommended protocol suite.
			In the diagram, transmission of data crosses two routers and over the Internet to reach its
			destination. By following the data along the arrows, we see it pass through various layers of
			communication and processing as it crosses the internal network, through the first router,
			across the public network (internet connection), into the recipient’s router, and then is
			reassembled into its original form.</p>
		
			<p>Until recently, most network equipment has operated on IPv4, the fourth standard released 
			for IP addresses, which has been in place for about thirty years. Addresses in this
			format are typically represented as a pattern of four blocks of up to three digits separated by
			periods, with no block of numbers exceeding 255 such as 127.0.0.1 or 24.38.1.251. This is
			referred to as dot-decimal representation, and although it is not the only way to express an
			IPv4 address it is the most recognized form. Segments of the addresses within the ranges
			of 192.168.xxx.xxx, 172.16.xxx.xxx to 172.31.xxx.xxx, and 10.0.xxx.xxx to 10.255.xxx.xxx
			are reserved for private networks, meaning they are used within a network in your house,
			at work, or anywhere else where a group of computers share a connection to the internet.</p>
		
			<p>Each of these networks uses one or more of these blocks of numbers for devices on that
network. Only the equipment connecting that local network to the Internet needs a unique
address from the rest of the world. That equipment will track which computer inside the
network to send data to and from by reading packets—the individual pieces of messages
that are sent across networks. This means your computer might be 192.168.1.25 at home,
and so might your computer at work, according to your home and work networks. The
connection between your house and office thought still have a different, unique number
assigned to them.</p>
		
		<p>This separation of networks was done to reduce the speed at which unique addresses
were consumed. Although this scheme allows for almost 4.3 billion (accurately, 232) ad-
dresses, the last one was officially assigned on February 4th, 2012. To sustain today’s growing
number of devices, IPv6 was created, which is depicted as eight blocks of four hexadecimal
digits now separated by colons. These new addresses might look like 2001:0db8:85a3:0042
:1000:8a2e:0370:7334, and can support roughly 4 billion unique addresses. Since the new
range is so staggeringly large, additional protocols were created that specify when certain
values or ranges are used in addresses. This allows additional information about the device
to be conveyed just from the address.</p>
		
		<p>The actual messages sent between machines are broken down into multiple pieces. These
pieces, called packets, are sent piece by piece from sender to recipient. Each packet is sent
the fastest way possible, which means some packets may take different routes—picture a
short cut, or getting off a congested road to take a different one. This helps to ensure that
the message gets from sender to receiver as fast as possible, but also means packets may
arrive in a different order than they were sent.</p>
		
		<p>To account for this, each piece of the message, or payload, is wrapped in a header—
additional information that describes how many other pieces there are, what protocol is
being used, where the packet came from and is headed to, along with some other related
information.</p>
		
			<p><b>URL</b><br>Seeing as most of us would have a hard time remembering what IP address is needed to
			get to, say, Facebook (173.252.100.16) or the Weather Channel (96.8.80.132) we instead
			use URLs, universal resource locators. This allows us to use www.facebook.com and www.
			weather.com to get to where we want to go without referring to a long list of IP addresses.
			Specialized servers (called name servers) all around the world are responsible for responding
			to requests from computers for this information. When you type facebook.com into your
			address bar, if your router does not have a note of its own as to where that is, it will “ask” a
			name server, which will look it up in its records and reply.</p>
		
			<p>There are three parts to a network address: the protocol, name, and resource id. The
			protocol represents how we want to send and receive messages, for example we can use
			http:// for accessing websites and ftp:// for moving files. The name is what we associate with the site, 
			like www.facebook.com, and the resource id, or URI, is everything after that,
			which points to the particular file we want to see.</p>
		
			<p><b>Ports</b><br>
While an IP address and a URL will bring you to a particular web server, there may be
more than one way you want to interact with it, or more than one thing you want it to do.
Maybe you also want the server to provide email services, or you want to use FTP to update
your files. These ports act as different doors into your server, so different applications can
communicate without getting in each other’s way. Certain ports are typically used for cer-
tain activities, for example port 80 is the standard port for web traffic (your browser viewing
a page), as opposed to ftp, which typically uses port 21. Using standard ports is not a rule,
as applications can be configured to use any available port number, but it is recommended
in most cases as firewalls and other security devices may require additional configuring to
keep them from blocking wanted traffic because it is arriving at an unusual, fire walled, or
“locked” port.</p>
		
			<p><b>Hosting Facilities</b><br>
If you are using a server that is not under your physical care, and is managed by an off-
site third party, then you likely have an agreement with a hosting facility. Hosting facilities
are typically for-profit companies that manage the physical equipment necessary to provide
access to websites for a number of clients. Many offer web development and management
services as well, but if you are still reading, then that tidbit is probably of little interest as
you are here to build it yourself.</p>
			
			<p>The benefit of using a hosting service falls under the same principles as other cloud
computing services. You are paying to rent equipment and/or services in place of investing
in equipment and managing the server and Internet connection yourself. Additionally,
hosting facilities are equipped with backup power sources as well as redundant connections
to the internet, and may even have multiple facilities that are physically dispersed, ensuring
their clients have the best up time as possible. Ads like the one below are common to these
services and often emphasize their best features. Price competition makes for relatively
affordable hosting for those who are not looking for dedicated servers and are comfortable
with sharing their (virtual) server resources with other customers.</p>
		
			<p><b>Chapter 7: Markup Languages</b></p>	
			
			<p>Document markup is a notation method that defines how particular pieces of information
are meant to be formatted. The term comes from the practice of marking up manuscripts to
notate changes that need to be made. Markup in terms of programming languages is used
to identify a language that specifies how a document is to appear.</p>
		
			<p>If you have ever used multiple colors of ink or highlighter when making notes and
ascribed meaning to those colors for yourself (e.g., yellow highlighter is important, red
ink is a definition) then you have already practiced document markup. You are providing
additional layers of information along with the written text, in this case visual cues as to the
purpose of the written information.</p>
		
			<p>Some popular markup languages are hypertext markup language (HTML), extensible
markup language (XML) and extensible hypertext markup language (XHTML).These
were each created to fulfill particular needs in defining the layout and structure of the
material.</p>
		
		<p><b>HTML5</b><br>Hypertext markup language is used to aid in the publication of web pages by providing
a structure that defines elements like tables, forms, lists and headings, and identifies where
different portions of our content begin and end. It can be used to embed other file formats
like videos, audio files, documents like PDFs and spreadsheets, among others. HTML is
the most relied upon language in the creation of web sites. In this text we will focus on
HTML5. While it is technically still in draft form, many proposed elements are already
supported by the newer versions of most of the popular browsers.</p>
