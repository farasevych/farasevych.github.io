		<p><b>Chapter 1: Brief History of the Internet</b></p>
			<p>As far back as the early stirrings of the Cold War, the concept of a network connecting
			computers was under development by both government and university researchers looking
			for a better means to communicate and share research. The military at the time relied in
			part on microwave transmission technology for communications. An unexpected attack on
			some of these towers demonstrated how susceptible the technology was to failure of even
			small portions of the transmission path. This led the military to seek a method of communicating 
			that could withstand attack. At the same time, university researchers were trying
			to share their work between campuses, and were struggling with similar problems when
			their transmissions suffered drops in signal. Parties from both groups ended up at the same
			conference with presentations, and decided to collaborate in order to further their work.</p>
		
			<p>At the time, computers were far from what we know them as today. A single computer
			was a large, immobile assortment of equipment that took up an entire room. Data entry was
			done by using punched cards of paper, or the newest method of the time, magnetic tapes.
			Interacting with the computer meant reserving time on the equipment and traveling to
			where it was. Most machines were owned by universities, large corporations, or government
			organizations due to the staffing demands, size, and cost to acquire and maintain them. The
			image below depicts the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNIVAC_I" alt="Univac 1">UNIVAC 1</a>, a system used by the United States Census Bureau
			and other large organizations like universities. One of the fastest machines at the time, it
			could perform roughly 1000 calculations per second.</p>
		
			<p>In comparison, the K computer, a super computer produced in 2012 by the Japanese
			company Fujitsu, was capable of 10 petaflops per second when it was launched. Before you reach for your dictionary or calculator, we will break that down. FLOPS stands for
			floating point operations per second, or in basic terms, the number of calculations the
			system can finish in one second. A petaflop is a numerical indicator of how many 1015 (10
			with 15 zeroes after it) calculations are completed per second. So, 10 petaflops means the
			K computer can complete 1015 calculations ten times in one second. If we fed the UNIVAC
			1 just a single petaflop of data the day it was turned on, it would still be working on the
			problem today. In fact, it would barely be getting started, just a mere 60+ years into a
			roughly 317,098-year task!</p>
		
			<p>As cold war tensions grew and Sputnik was launched, the United States Department of
			Defense (DoD) began to seek additional methods of transmitting information to supple-
			ment existing methods. They sought something that was decentralized, allowing better
			resiliency in case of attack, where damage at one point would not necessarily disrupt com-
			munication. Their network, Arpanet, connected the DoD and participating universities
			together for the first time. In order to standardize the way networked systems communicated, 
			the Transfer Control Protocol/Internetwork Protocol (TCP/IP) was created. As
			various network systems migrated to this standard, they could then communicate with any
			network using the protocol. <b>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet" alt="Internet history">Internet</a> was born</b>.</p>
		
			<p>Email was soon to follow, as users of the networks were interested in the timely transmission 
			and notification of messages. This form of messaging fit one of their initial goals.
			As time progressed, additional protocols were developed to address particular tasks, like
			FTP for file transfers and UDP for time-sensitive, error-resistant tasks.</p>
		
			<p>Ongoing improvements in our ability to move more information, and move it faster,
			between systems progressed at a rate similar to the calculative power of the computers we
			saw earlier. This brings us to where we are today; able to watch full-length movies, streamed
			in high quality right to our phones and computers, even while riding in a car.</p>
		
		<p><b>Chapter 4: Network Basics</b></p>
			<p>An IP (Internet Protocol) address is a unique code that identifies a piece of equipment
			connected to a network. These addresses are used in messages between network devices like
			the network or wireless card in your computer, the equipment from your ISP (internet
			service provider), and all pieces of equipment between your machine and the one your
			computer needs to talk to.</p>
		
			<p>IP Addresses live in the network layer, which is one of seven layers in the protocol suite
			defined in the OSI Model. The OSI model stands for Open Systems Interconnection, and
			was created by the International Organization for Standardization, an international non-
			governmental group of professionals who strive to establish standards and best practices
			in a variety of fields. The OSI Model for networking breaks the system of transmitting data
			into the layers show below in an attempt to delineate where certain actions should take place.</p>
